# Working out solutions to CodeWars katas

Largely focusing on JavaScript at the moment.

Katas that are in the home directory are not functional yet. Once submitted & accepted, I move them into the "language/kyu" directories.

Kyu directories indicate difficulty level. 8 kyu are easiest and they get harder as the numbers get smaller.

## Shell Script Conventions

- \$1 is title of the Kata
- \$2 is the kyu rating (number)
- \$3 is the link to the kata page
- \$4 is the language
- \$5 is the file extension (no dot)

```sh
codewars {title} {kyu number} {link} {language} {extension}
```
