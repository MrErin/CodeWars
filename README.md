# Working out solutions to CodeWars katas
Largely focusing on JavaScript at the moment.

Katas that are in the home directory are not functional yet. Once submitted & accepted, I move them into the "kyu" directories.

Kyu directories indicate difficulty level. 8 kyu are easiest and they get harder as the numbers get smaller.
