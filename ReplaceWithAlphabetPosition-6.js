Code Wars Kata Instructions:

Welcome.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

a being 1, b being 2, etc.

As an example:

alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" as a string.

*/


//my solution

const alphabetPosition = (string) => {
    let numString = ''
    let correspondences = 




    return numString
    return correspondences
}

const a = 'The sunset sets at twelve o\' clock.'
console.log(alphabetPosition(a))
