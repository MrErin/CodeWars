Code Wars Kata Instructions:

Simple Encryption: Alternating Split
Code Wars Instructions:
For building the encrypted string:
Take every 2nd char from the string, then the other chars, that are not every 2nd char, and concat them as new String.
Do this n times!

Examples:

"This is a test!", 1 -> "hsi  etTi sats!"
"This is a test!", 2 -> "hsi  etTi sats!" -> "s eT ashi tist!"

Write two methods:

function encrypt(text, n)
function decrypt(encryptedText, n)
For both methods:
If the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value!
If n is <= 0 then return the input text.

//this looks like it uses Regular Expressions and interpolation. Need further research to break down what's happening
